# DjangoHelloWorldJSON
## Lab 5 Assignment for Software Architecture and Design 

###### Starting/Running the web app "Hello World":
1. Make sure you are in the correct directory which is quick_project (Command: cd quick_project)
2. Once you are in that directory, you will type the command to run the server -- python3.8 manage.py runserver
** If this does not work, try running without the 3.8 version, or check what version you have on your VM **
3. Go to your browser of choice, such as firefox, and type in the URL bar: https://127.0.0.1:8000/json or https://localhost:8000/json
4. Once the web app has loaded, you will see the JSON response in the web app :) 

###### Helpful Tips:
- Make sure you have python3 installed! Check by going to python3 -- version command in your terminal
- Also, you will need pip and django installed (You need pip to install django first) 
- DOUBLE CHECK YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTORY!! (and the name is correct)
